		<h3> Informatics </h3>
		<p>I am studying Informatics for a third year now. This year, we have been learning how to work in CSS and HTML. Using Khan Academy was very helpful for my as a I was a novice in these comptuer languages. Graphic design is entertaining, and I am eager to learn even more. I believe this is going to be useful in the future when I would need to create my own website.</p>

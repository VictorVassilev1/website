        <h2>Mohamed Salah: Liverpool forward to miss Egypt games</h2>
        <h6>Posted on November 13, 2019</h6>
        
        <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah will miss Egypt's Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros with an ankle injury.

The 27-year-old was substituted in the 87th minute of Sunday's 3-1 Premier League win over Manchester City after picking up the knock in a challenge with Fernandinho.

Salah met up with Egypt in Cairo on Tuesday for tests on the injury.

"The injury needs a period of treatment to recover," said an Egypt statement.

Salah missed Liverpool's draw against Manchester United in October after a tackle by Leicester's Hamza Choudhury injured the same joint.</p>
        
         <h2> Delph injured</h2>
        <h6>Posted on November 13, 2019</h6>
        <p>Everton's Fabian Delph has left the England camp because of injury and returned to the Premier League club.

The 29-year-old midfielder arrived at St George's Park with a hamstring problem that ruled him out of Everton's win at Southampton on Saturday.

It was hoped he would be available to play a part in England's upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers but the injury has not healed in time.

No replacements are planned for the games with Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
